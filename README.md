# Google Capstone Project
This project aimed to analyze the riding patterns of clients who use the bike sharing services offered by Cyclistic, a company based in Chicago, and identify potential trends that could help the company convert casual riders to annual members.
## Background
Cyclistic is a bike sharing program which features more than 5,800 bikes and 692 docking stations across Chicago. It offers single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Since annual memberships bring more profit than single-ride passes and full-day passes, the marketing director wished to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders, i.e., who purchase single-ride passes and full-day passes, into annual members.
I joined the data analytics team as a junior data analyst. My job in this project was to answer the business question raised by the marketing director: â€œHow do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic differently?"
